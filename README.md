# Quantile Regression: A Robust Alternative to OLS  

This project explores **Quantile Regression** as a powerful alternative to traditional Linear Regression, particularly for analyzing datasets with heteroscedasticity, outliers, or non-normal error distributions. While Linear Regression estimates the mean effect of predictors on the response variable, Quantile Regression goes beyond by modeling the relationship at different points (quantiles) of the response distribution.  

### Key Highlights:  
- **Understanding Quantile Regression**: Demonstrates how it provides a more nuanced view by capturing predictor impacts across various performance levels or income groups.  
- **Comparison with OLS**: Showcases the limitations of Linear Regression in datasets with variable spread or outliers, and highlights the robustness and flexibility of Quantile Regression.  
- **Applications**: Analyzes multiple datasets to illustrate the benefits of Quantile Regression in real-world scenarios, such as income analysis and student performance prediction.  

### Outcomes:  
This project emphasizes the role of Quantile Regression in providing actionable insights across diverse fields, outperforming traditional approaches in many complex settings. A detailed comparison with OLS is included, highlighting the improved fit and interpretability of quantile-based methods.
